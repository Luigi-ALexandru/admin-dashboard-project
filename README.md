This project was both frustrating and rewarding.

While studying CSS Grid, I had an easy time understanding it from examples but when it came to put it into practice and create my own website, I realized I couldn't remember anything.

So I had to go back and check different ways of doing it. Now that I've done it, it will stick to me!

Made lots of mistakes and I'm not happy with the end result, I could have simplified things a lot more now that I'm looking back at it but I didn't want to re-start the whole project nor re-work it. Next website will definitely be much better than this one.
